## 1. Overview
This document outlines the product requirements for a **Headless AI Chat API**. The core problem this product solves is the significant backend complexity and development overhead required to build a flexible, powerful, and model-agnostic AI chat service.

This product is for **software developers** who need a reliable, well-documented, and portable API to power chat features in their applications. It abstracts away the intricacies of interacting with different AI models, providing a single, consistent interface. The primary value is in its portability and powerful orchestration capabilities, allowing a developer to deploy it easily within a Vercel/Next.js project for a quick demo, or scale it independently on a cloud provider like AWS for production use.

---

## 2. Core Features
The product is defined by its powerful backend capabilities, delivered through a clean API interface.

### Feature 1: Model-Agnostic AI Orchestration
* **Description:** A robust backend service, built with Python and LangChain, that serves as a central orchestration layer to various AI model providers. The system will initially support Google's Gemini models, with the architecture designed to be easily configurable to use OpenAI (ChatGPT) or Anthropic (Claude) models in the future.
* **Value:** This future-proofs any application built on this API. Developers can switch the underlying AI model via a simple configuration change to optimize for cost, performance, or capability, all without altering the consuming frontend application.
* **High-Level Functionality:** The service is configured via server-side environment variables (e.g., `MODEL_PROVIDER`, `MODEL_API_KEY`). Based on this configuration, the API transparently routes requests to the appropriate external AI service, handling any differences in their SDKs or request formats.

### Feature 2: Standardized Streaming API
* **Description:** A primary API endpoint that provides a consistent, streaming-first contract for chat conversations. The API will accept a standardized message history format and return a streaming response of plain text, making it simple for any client to consume.
* **Value:** Provides a predictable and easy-to-use interface for any developer. The streaming-first design ensures a responsive, real-time user experience for the end-user of the client application.
* **High-Level Functionality:** A developer makes a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/chat` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the message history. The API immediately begins streaming back the AI's response as it's generated.

### Feature 3: Cloud-Agnostic & Portable Design
* **Description:** The API is built using a standard, high-performance Python framework (FastAPI) and is fully containerized using Docker. This ensures it is not locked into any single hosting provider.
* **Value:** Maximum deployment flexibility. A developer can get started quickly by dropping the API into a Vercel project, then seamlessly migrate the exact same codebase to AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, or any other container-supporting platform as their needs evolve.
* **High-Level Functionality:** The project includes a `Dockerfile` that packages the application and all its dependencies. The application itself is framework-based and does not rely on any provider-specific services for its core logic.

## 3. User Experience
For an API, the "User Experience" is the **Developer Experience (DX)**.

### User Personas
* **Devin, the Developer:** Devin is a full-stack developer building a web application. He wants to add a powerful AI chat feature but wants to focus on the frontend UI, not the backend complexity. He needs a backend API that is well-documented, easy to deploy and configure, and provides clear, predictable error messages. His goal is to have a functional API endpoint running in his preferred cloud environment in minutes.

### Key User Flows
* **Flow 1 - Developer: Local Development and Testing**
    1.  Devin clones the API's Git repository.
    2.  He sets up his local `.env` file with his Gemini API key.
    3.  He runs the application locally using Docker Compose.
    4.  He uses a tool like Postman or `curl` to send a request to his local `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat` endpoint and verifies that he receives a streaming response.
* **Flow 2 - Developer: Deploying to a Serverless Platform**
    1.  Devin connects his Git repository to his hosting provider (e.g., Vercel or AWS).
    2.  He configures the required environment variables (`MODEL_PROVIDER`, `MODEL_API_KEY`, `CORS_ORIGIN`) in the provider's dashboard.
    3.  He pushes his code to the main branch, triggering a deployment.
    4.  He receives a public URL for his API and can now integrate it with his frontend application.

### Developer Experience (DX) & API Design Principles
* **RESTful Principles:** The API should follow standard REST conventions.
* **Auto-Generated Documentation:** The API will use FastAPI's capabilities to automatically generate interactive OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation, so Devin can explore and test the endpoints in his browser.
* **Streaming First:** The primary chat endpoint will use streaming to provide the best possible performance for the client.
* **Clear Error Handling:** The API will use standard HTTP status codes and provide a consistent JSON error schema (`{ "detail": "Error message" }`) for failed requests.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### System Components
* **Frontend:** `N/A` (This product is a headless API).
* **Backend:** `Python` with `FastAPI`.
* **Database:** `N/A` for MVP.
* **Authentication:** A simple API key passed in the request header (`X-API-Key`) for basic security.

### Data Models
* **ChatRequest (Pydantic Model):** `{ messages: list[Message] }`
* **Message (Pydantic Model):** `{ role: str, content: str }`
* **ErrorResponse (Pydantic Model):** `{ detail: str }`

### APIs and Integrations
* **Internal API:**
    * `POST /api/v1/chat`: The primary streaming endpoint for conversations.
    * `GET /api/v1/health`: A simple health check endpoint that returns a `200 OK` status.
* **External Integrations:**
    * `LangChain`: Used as the core orchestration library in the backend.
    * `Google Gemini API`: The initial AI model provider.
    * `OpenAI API`, `Anthropic API`: To be supported in future versions.

### Infrastructure Requirements
* **Hosting:** Any hosting platform supporting Python serverless functions or Docker containers (e.g., Vercel, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run).
* **Containerization:** `Docker` is required for packaging the application for portability.
* **CI/CD:** A standard CI/CD pipeline triggered by commits to the main branch via a Git provider.

## 5. Development Roadmap

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Requirements
The goal of the MVP is to deliver a deployable, functional, and well-documented API service.
* **Feature A: Backend API with Gemini Support:** A deployable FastAPI service that can process chat requests using LangChain and the Gemini API, configured via an environment variable.
* **Feature B: Containerization:** A working `Dockerfile` that packages the application and its dependencies.
* **Feature C: Auto-generated API Documentation:** The OpenAPI (Swagger UI) documentation must be enabled and accessible.
* **Feature D: Core Documentation:** A detailed `README.md` explaining the API contract, environment variables, local setup, and deployment instructions.

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
* **Phase 2:**
    * Introduce a more robust authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT).
    * Add support for OpenAI and Anthropic models, selectable via environment variables.
    * Implement structured logging for better observability.
    
* **Phase 3:**
    * Add an endpoint for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to allow "training" on custom data.
    * Implement request rate limiting.
    * Create a caching layer to reduce costs and latency for repeated queries.

## 6. Logical Dependency Chain
The development will proceed in this order to ensure a usable state is reached as quickly as possible.

1.  **Foundation (Backend First):**
    * Set up the FastAPI project structure and Dockerfile.
    * Implement the core LangChain service logic to connect to the Gemini API and get a simple, non-streaming response.
    * Create the `POST /api/v1/chat` endpoint and the `GET /api/v1/health` endpoint.
2.  **Core Usable Feature (Streaming & Docs):**
    * Refactor the `/chat` endpoint to support streaming responses.
    * Implement Pydantic models for request validation and enable the auto-generated Swagger UI documentation.
    * Test the streaming endpoint thoroughly using `curl` or a simple test script.
3.  **Integration & Deployment:**
    * Write the `README.md` documentation.
    * Deploy the containerized application to a target platform (e.g., Vercel) and verify all endpoints are working correctly.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
* **Risk:** Managing Python dependencies and container sizes to ensure fast cold starts on serverless platforms.
* **Mitigation:** Use multi-stage Docker builds and keep the dependency footprint minimal. Test cold start performance early in the development cycle.

### MVP Scope Creep
* **Risk:** The temptation to add support for all model providers or a database for conversation history to the MVP.
* **Mitigation:** This PRD strictly defines the MVP scope. All other features are captured in the "Future Enhancements" backlog and will be prioritized after the initial launch.

### Resource Constraints
* **Risk:** As a template/personal project, development time is the main constraint.
* **Mitigation:** A tight focus on the defined MVP. FastAPI and LangChain are chosen specifically to accelerate development.
